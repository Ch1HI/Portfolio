            During the English Month celebration, one of the exciting events was the Book Parade, where students from all grade levels dressed up as their favorite characters. My best friend, Reeza, and I had a blast dressing up as Astoria and Daphne Greengrass from Harry Potter. We were both excited to bring the Slytherin house to life and it felt like we were truly part of the magical world. We also had fun playing with our wands.

It was a moment of unity and excitement, as each team gathered to kick off the competition. The four teams—Yellow Bakunawa, Blue Minokawa, Green Magindara, and Red Santelmos—showed their team spirit with pride. Each team’s name reflected a unique symbol from Filipino mythology, adding a special cultural touch to the event. The torch lighting ceremony signaled the start of the games, and everyone was eager to showcase their skills and sportsmanship throughout the intramurals.

            The 9-Fairness class celebrated Teachers' Day with a fun and lively event, where everyone wore blue to show their appreciation. The highlight of the celebration was a game of *Penoy Henyo*, specially prepared by the students for the teachers. In the video, Ms. Uminga eagerly answered the clues, while Ms. Mei did her best to guess the words. The game added a lot of excitement and laughter, making the Teachers' Day celebration even more memorable and special for everyone involved.
